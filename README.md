# Micro-frontend playground

Micro-frontends require a bit of set up. This playground is a starting point to help with debugging and exploration. 

Born out of frustration at having built pretty much this exact app multiple times.

## Get Started
1. fork the project
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn dev`

Built with [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/).
